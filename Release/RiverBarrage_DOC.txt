GAME INSTRUCTIONS 

This is a game for 1 or 2 players.

Player 1 controls agent 1, in a white 
boat. The boat is armed with a long 
distance rifle which can only fire 
forward.

Player 2 controls agent 2, in a yellow
boat. The boat is armed with a missile
launcher, which can fire directional.

A terrorist ring leader has captured a 
National Park, and has sent his hench 
people to drop mines into the river.
He is plotting to destroy a dam which 
is there to protect neighbouring 
villages from being flooded. What used 
to be a large beautiful natural 
tourist attraction has been transformed
into a deadly war zone. Sightings of 
the leader has been spotted inside a 
blue plane - heading towards the dam.
He must be stopped!

Your mission is to guide your boat 
through the National Park and find the 
terrorist ring leader's plane. You will
not be alone because you will have to 
fight his hench army with your own 
firepower. The enemy forces are based
on ground, air and water. Some enemies 
will require more than one hit before 
they are destroyed. Some other enemies 
will target your boat before engaging
fire. 

During your travel, you will encounter
various obstacles. Some of which must 
be avoided, and others which can be 
shot. These include mines. Floating 
mines can be shot, the underwater mines
dropped by grey military boats cannot 
be shot. You should avoid running your 
boat onto the mines, otherwise a life
will be lost. Other deadly obstacles, 
which can be shot include bridges and 
hungry crocodiles. Mind you, we would 
not want one of those reptiles to 
clamber on board your boat do we?

Rescue swimmers who are stuck in the 
water. For every swimmer rescued, you 
will be awarded 1,000 points. 

Pick up life rings for 2,000 points. 
The higher the score.

Extra lives are awarded for every 
10,000 points reached. Unless of 
course, you already have 9 lives in the 
lives counter.

Can you help save the dam (and its 
neighbouring villages) from being 
destroyed before it is too late?

Good luck agents!
