Welcome to the generic scrolling game 
engine source code for 
RIVER BARRAGE

This project will require the entire 
library from Martin Piper's Github 
link in order to 
get the project to work. 

Download source from the github link. 
https://github.com/martinpiper/C64Public 
(Download zip) 

Unzip it somewhere.

Then copy the RIVER BARRAGE project 
as a new project inside the C64Public 
directory.

When you are ready you can
Run buildIt.bat

The project should then compile and 
compress River Barrage. However, make
sure the path on the cruncher and 
VICE is correct. Change the directories
where necessary.

The complete library here has been 
modified to build River Barrage.

This source contains all the 
enhancements that are featured in this 
game. 

These include:

* New front end with hi score table 
  and in game sound options
* Get Ready screen
* Game over screen
* Game complete / end screen
* In game enhancements, featuring:
* Additional code for handling in game 
  music or sound effects from title 
  screen
* Player shield (The player flashes) 
  on every spawn of each player either 
  at the start of the game or after 
  losing a life.
* Background animations (Wrapping 
individual characters to replicate the 
ripple effect of the water)
* Custom score panel
.. and possibly a few other things not 
mentioned.

EXTRAS

This project also consists of a 
picture linker intro in which displays
a loading bitmap and plays the 
loading music.

The release folder consists of both 
D64 and tape version of the finished 
game. The tape version was remastered
using Tape Master Pro V5.0, which can 
be found at:

https://richard-tnd.itch.io/tape-master-pro

All C64 files can be found inside the 
C64 folder. All work files can be 
loaded into Charpad V2.7.6, Spritepad
V2.0. Music files can be loaded into 	
GoatTracker Ultra V1.5.5. 

I hope you have loads of fun exploring 
the River Barrage project and I hope it 
will give you an idea on how SEUCK 
really can be pushed to its limit if 
using this source the correct way.	
	
Have fun.
